### How to use:

Use your phone's camera to capture images and create a color palette.

- You can refine individual colors of a palette
- Use the Color Dropper feature to fully customize your own palette
- Capture up to 12 colors simulatniously using the camera (you can always add more using the Color Dropper feature)
